## üíª About

> Development of a prototype tool that will be able to support DHL Express operation team‚Äôs lead generation process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Context

DHL Express aspires to build a clean B2B database of 400,000 to 500,000 customers through various touchpoints (e.g. customer service, operations, etc.) As part of its operational enhancement, the company is seeking to develop a tool that can better assist in their B2B lead generation.

**Current Pain Points:**
- Information on the suspects is unstructured ‚Äì no consistent format on data input
- Further filtration from suspects to prospects, and conversion from prospects to customers are done through mass/broad-based strategies (e.g. telemarketing team disseminating general marketing materials to all suspects)

- The tool is to be able to systematically clean, score, and prioritize existing customer lead data
- The tool should help DHL Express to better target its leads and convert them to customers

	- Table - Read all the record from database
